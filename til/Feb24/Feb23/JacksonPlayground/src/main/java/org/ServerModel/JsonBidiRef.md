When you have bi-directional relationships between entities, such as a parent-child relationship, using these annotations can help to avoid infinite recursion during the serialization process.

Here's a brief overview of how they are typically used:

@JsonManagedReference: This annotation is used on the "parent" side of the relationship to indicate that this side "manages" the relationship. It is typically used on the field or getter method of the parent entity class. When an instance of the parent entity is serialized to JSON, the reference to the child entities is included.

@JsonBackReference: This annotation is used on the "child" side of the relationship to indicate that this side is the "back" reference. It is typically used on the field or getter method of the child entity class. When an instance of the child entity is serialized to JSON, the reference to the parent entity is omitted to break the bi-directional relationship and prevent infinite recursion.
