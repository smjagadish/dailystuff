Lazy capture for azure private endpoint and/or private link service
* azure private endpoint and/or private link service is mainly intended for private access to azure managed services .
* More sepcifically , cutting out any form of internet transitting from app to the azure managed service is the major takeaway from the private endpoint and the private link service
* private endpoint takes care of providing a private IP from the vnet hosting the app (also called as service consumer henceforth)
* the private endpoint connects the service consumer to to a azure managed service that is backed by the private link
* common examples of such service include - azure cosmos , azure sql db etc.
* connectivity using the private endpoint always follows the direction of service consumer - service
* more than 1 private endpoint resource can be created for a single private link resource
* private endpoints also have elements of network security baked in
* private endpoints co-exist with the public endpoints (if any) and do not restrict access from any service consumer to the resource (attached to the private link service) over the public ip
* network policlies , network security groups etc. are applicable for the private endpoints too
* its important to configure an entry for the private endpoint fqdn in the private dns zone
* this will ensure apps continue to use the same connection url / string ( which may have referred to public endpoint fqdn)
* also, when using pvt link for k8s loadbalanced services, keep in mind that the lb has to be internal lb (not public) for the pvt link to work
* pvt link/pvt endpoint is the brains behind aks private clusters
* pvt endpoint in our resource group linked to pvt resource in azure resource group

use the nginx deploy files and the pvt endpoint create file
pvt link creation automated thru the annotation in nginx file but pvt endpoint must be created manually
creation from portal fails, so use the az shell commands to create
